# 🔒 FHE Demo

A simple "Hello FHE World" using Python to illustrate the concept of **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** — performing computations directly on encrypted data without decrypting it.

This is a playful mock implementation inspired by the concepts behind [Zama](https://zama.ai/) and its FHE toolkits.

## 🚀 How it works

- Takes two numbers from user input.
- Encrypts them (simulated with a simple wrapper).
- Adds them while still "encrypted".
- Decrypts to show the result.

## 🐍 Run it

```bash
python fhe-demo.py
